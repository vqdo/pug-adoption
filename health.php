    				<p>Pugs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're 
    				prone to certain health conditions. The most common of problems
    				are <a href="http://www.pugvillage.com/pug-health/pug-genetic-issues">genetic diseases</a>.
    				Not all Pugs will have any or all of these diseases, but 
    				it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.
    				<br><br>
    				As an adoption website we highly recommend that you get your
    				new family member through one of our sponsored shelters for 
    				pugs. But if you are considering a breeder there are a few 
    				things to keep in mind.
    				<br><br>
    				Have the breeder show you health clearances for both your 
    				puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been
    				tested for and cleared of a particular condition.
    				<br><br>
    				Take a look at the links listed above to get more insight on
    				the types of health and safety measures you should be taking
    				with your new pug.

He tends to be a sedentary dog, content to sit in your lap as you read a book or watch a movie.</p></td>
