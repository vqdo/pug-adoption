    			<h1>A Brief History of Pugs</h1>
    			<div class="roundbox">
    				<p>The truth of how the Pug came into existence is shrouded 
    				in mystery, but he has been true to his breed down through 
    				the ages since before 400 B.C. Authorities agree that he is 
    				of Oriental origin with some basic similarities to the 
    				Pekingese. China is the earliest known source for the breed,
    				where he was the pet of the Buddhist monasteries in Tibet. 
    				The breed next appeared in Japan and then in Europe, where 
    				it became the favorite for various royal courts.
    				<br><br>
    				The Pug became the official dog of the House of Orange after
    				one of the breed saved the life of William, Prince of Orange
    				, by giving alarm at the approach of the Spaniards at 
    				Hermingny in 1572. Later when William II landed at Torbay to
    				be crowned King of England, his cortege included Pugs and 
    				they became the fashionable breed for generations.

He tends to be a sedentary dog, content to sit in your lap as you read a book or watch a movie.</p></td>
