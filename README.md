TECHNICAL INFORMATION
=======================

This site uses PHP and will not display correctly without a running web server
and a modern browser. Therefore, we've provided a link to our site to mitigate
the inconvenience of running it locally. 

We did not implement the back end for this project. The search button on the 
adoption page will work (by display dummy entries), but no actual records are
retrieved from a database.
