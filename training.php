    				<p>Tricks are both enjoyable and extremely useful. Really, 
    				dog tricks are not much different from a person performing 
    				gymnastics, doing algebra, dancing, sinking a putt or
    				playing the piano - all learned physical and mental skills, 
    				practiced to perfection. Similarly, dog tricks are no 
    				different from basic obedience commands. Although a lot of 
    				dogs perform obedience exercises more reliably than tricks, 
    				and a lot of dogs have more fun performing tricks than 
    				obedience commands, it need not and, indeed, shouldn't be 
    				that way. Tricks should be as precise and reliable as 
    				obedience commands - as precise as scoring a perfect 10. 
    				And basic obedience should be as much fun as performing 
    				tricks - as much fun as dancing.

He tends to be a sedentary dog, content to sit in your lap as you read a book or watch a movie.</p></td>
